        <h2>About This Guide</h2>
        <p>Welcome to this basic How-To guide to help you get started in using the Google Books API.</p>
        <p>This guide is focused on people beginning to use APIs, with little programming experience, and will help you figure out how to set up basic searches with the Google Books API.  It focuses solely on what is available to access publicly.  There are ways to access more private data, but that is not covered in this How-To guide.</p>
        <p>As this is a Google Product, there is additional information on this API on the Google Developers site, found <a href="https://developers.google.com/books/">here</a>.  Again, this guide is meant to help people who are just starting exploring APIs understand the documentation found elsewhere better.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>What is Google Books?</h2>
        <p>Now, you might be wondering what Google Books is anyway.  I admit, it is not Google's most popular product.  You are likely more familiar with Google Maps, Google Earth, Google Drive or even Gmail.  When you think of books, you probably thing of bookstores, libraries, Amazon, etc.  But Google does have a Books product.</p>
        <p>Google Books represents the efforts by Google, Inc. to digitize books and magazines.  Essentially, the goal is to convert the full text of books and magazines to an online presence and to store it in Google's digital database.  Google has a goal of to scan all distinct titles in the world by the end of the decade.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Uses of Google Books as an API</h2>
        <p>As you might guess, the majority of Google Book's use as an API comes from academia and sites helping users find books to read.  Essentially those websites that have a reason to offer a book search option, but are not actually selling books themselves.  So bookclubs might use the Google Books API, but not bookstores.</p>
        <h2>Branding</h2>
        <p>To use the Google Books API Family, you must follow the Branding Guidelines.  Please click <a href="https://developers.google.com/books/branding">here</a> to view the Branding Guidelines.</p>
